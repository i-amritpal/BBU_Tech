## Project Overview:
The Flutter app is a secure event announcement and notes management application that enables users to securely store and manage their sensitive information such as personal notes and access to the department activities. The app is built using the Flutter framework, which is a popular mobile app development platform known for its crossplatform compatibility, performance, and ease of use.\
The app uses Firebase Cloud, a cloud-based storage solution, to store and synchronize user data securely. Firebase Cloud provides a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure allowing users to access their data from anywhere and anytime. The app also uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that all data is securely transmitted and stored.
#### The main features of the app include:
1. Event management: Users can create new events and store notes securely within the app. The notes can be organized using tags and categories for easy access and management
2. Event announcements: Users can easily access the previously organized and upcoming events that are going to be organized by the department. It also provides an event calendar to store and manage the events within the app. The login credentials are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms and can be accessed using Email/Password authentication.
3. Cloud sync: The Firebase Cloud app synchronizes user data across multiple devices. This ensures that users can access their notes and passwords from any device at any time.
4. End-to-end encryption: The app uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that all data is securely transmitted and stored. This ensures that only the user can access their data and that it remains protected from unauthorized access.
5. Secure login: The app uses secure login methods such as biometric authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the app and their data.
